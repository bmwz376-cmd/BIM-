**Meaning:** Building Information Modeling. A methodology for creating and utilizing digital models that contain not only 3D geometry but also attribute information and relationships.

### BEP (BIM Execution Plan)
**Pronunciation:** B-E-P / Bim Execution Plan  
**Meaning:** A planning document that defines objectives, role assignments, deliverables, and workflows in a BIM project.

### BIM360
**Pronunciation:** Bim Three-sixty  
**Meaning:** A cloud-based BIM platform provided by Autodesk to support collaborative work in design and construction.

### Clash Detection
**Pronunciation:** Clash Detection  
**Meaning:** Interference checking. A function that automatically detects spatial conflicts between structural, MEP, and architectural elements.

## D-G

### Element
**Pronunciation:** Element  
**Meaning:** Individual component objects that constitute a BIM model. Examples include walls, floors, columns, doors, windows, etc.

### Family
**Pronunciation:** Family  
**Meaning:** Component templates in Revit. Has a hierarchical structure: Category > Family > Type > Instance.

### Grid
**Pronunciation:** Grid  
**Meaning:** Reference lines for the building. Vertical and horizontal lines that serve as the basis for positioning columns and walls.

## H-L

### IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)
**Pronunciation:** I-F-C  
**Meaning:** International standard format for BIM data established by buildingSMART. Enables data exchange between different software applications.

### LOD (Level of Development)
**Pronunciation:** L-O-D / Level of Development  
**Meaning:** Stage of model development. Expressed in 5 stages from LOD100 (conceptual) to LOD500 (as-built).

## M-P

### Material
**Pronunciation:** Material  
**Meaning:** Material and finish information for components. Defines properties such as concrete, steel, glass, and other material characteristics.

### nD BIM
**Pronunciation:** N-D Bim  
**Meaning:** Multi-dimensional BIM that adds information axes such as time (4D), cost (5D), facility management (6D), and sustainability (7D) to 3D BIM.

### OPEN BIM
**Pronunciation:** Open Bim  
**Meaning:** The concept of exchanging and utilizing BIM data using open standards like IFC, independent of specific software vendors.

### Property
**Pronunciation:** Property  
**Meaning:** Non-geometric information attached to components. Includes materials, finishes, costs, performance values, etc.

---

## Q-T

### 4D BIM (Construction Simulation)
**Pronunciation:** Four-D Bim / Construction Simulation  
**Meaning:** Technology that adds a time axis (schedule) to BIM models to visually simulate construction sequences.

### 5D BIM
**Pronunciation:** Five-D Bim  
**Meaning:** Integration of cost information with 4D BIM, enabling cost management and estimation alongside time-based simulation.

## U-Z

### Worksharing
**Pronunciation:** Work-sharing  
**Meaning:** Collaborative workflow in Revit where multiple users can work on the same BIM model simultaneously through a central file stored on a server.

## Japanese Terms

### 通り芯 (Tōrishin / Grid Line)
**Pronunciation:** Too-ri-shin  
**Meaning:** Grid lines. Vertical and horizontal axis lines that serve as the building's reference.

### 属性情報 (Zokusei Jōhō / Property)
**Pronunciation:** Zoku-sei Jō-hō  
**Meaning:** Non-geometric information attached to components. Materials, finishes, costs, performance values, etc.

### 要素 (Yōso / Element)
**Pronunciation:** Yō-so  
**Meaning:** Individual component objects that constitute a BIM model. Walls, floors, columns, doors, windows, etc.

## Exam Preparation Tips

### High-Frequency Terms (Must Know)
- BIM, LOD, IFC, OPEN BIM
- Clash Detection
- 4D/5D BIM
- BEP (BIM Execution Plan)
- Family, Element

### Understanding Distinctions
- **BIM ≠ 3D modeling software**: BIM is a concept/process
- **LOD ≠ 3D detail**: LOD = information certainty
- **IFC = open standard**: Not vendor-specific

### Practical Application
- Understand **when** each LOD level is used
- Know **why** OPEN BIM is important
- Comprehend **how** clash detection prevents issues
