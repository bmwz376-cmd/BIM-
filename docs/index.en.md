## 🔑 Key Learning Points

### ❌ Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correct Understanding |
|---|---|
| BIM = 3D modeling | BIM = **Integrated building information management process** |
| BIM = Software name (Revit, etc.) | BIM = Concept; Revit is one implementation tool |
| LOD = 3D precision | LOD = **Information certainty & reliability** |
| BIM implementation = Instant efficiency | Initial learning cost, mid-to-long term benefits |
| IFC conversion is perfect | Information loss can occur (operational design is key) |

### ✅ Three Pillars for Success

1. **Understanding BIM Essence** - View as information design, not just 3D operation
2. **Standards & Specifications** - Accurate grasp of LOD, IFC, OPEN BIM meanings
3. **Practical Operational Knowledge** - Modeling mindset for downstream processes
